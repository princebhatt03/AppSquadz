// JavaScript is a Single Threaded and interpreted Programming language basically used for developing or creating Dynamic and interactive web pages, it is used for both client side and server side scripting

// Javascript is a Object-Oriented, Single Threaded, Interpreted, Event Driven, Asynchronous, Platform Independent, Capable of exception handling, Alows Anonymous Functions

/*JavaScript's flexibility extends to both the client-side and server-side, allowing developers to create complete web applications. Hereâ€™s how it functions in each environment:

Client-Side:

Involves controlling the browser and its DOM (Document Object Model).
Handles user events like clicks and form inputs.
Common libraries include AngularJS, ReactJS, and VueJS.

Server-Side:

Involves interacting with databases, manipulating files, and generating responses.
Node.js and frameworks like Express.js are widely used for server-side JavaScript, enabling full-stack development. */

// For running the JavaScript for Server side we need to install Node.js from nodejs.org
// Nodejs is Basically a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side scripting and the development of scalable network applications.
